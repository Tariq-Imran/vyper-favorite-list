Favorite List using Vyper

## Cyfrin Updraft Workshop

Spend at most 25 minutes on all of these prompts without the aide of AI. If you're unable to solve them after 25 minutes, stop, take a break, and then work with an AI or the discussions to help you solve them. Good luck!

1. Create a function called add that adds 1 to whatever is in self.favorite_number
2. Have the starting favorite number different from 7, check to make sure it's the number you set!
3. (Challenging) Create a new type using the "struct" keyword, and create a function that will save a new variable of that type to a state/storage variable.
